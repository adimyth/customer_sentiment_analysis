       "155829  1 out of 6 bulbs was defective and fizzled out after approximately 10 seconds of being powered on. Doubt I can return just the 1 for a partial refund so I'd recommend for people to buy bulbs individually because of this. The 6 for under $50 deal is good but its really 5 for $50 which is just average. Not to mention the bulbs don't seem quite as sturdy as I'd have hoped them to.<br /><br />Update 3/21 another bulb has burnt out shortly after buying. Now leaving 1 star on this item.

I pretty much bake everything from scratch: our sandwich bread, cornbread, granola (that has a little bit of flour in it), desert breads, cakes, hamburger buns etc., so I just keep this in half gallon mason jars on top of some shelves. They look nice and since 8 cups of whole berries makes about 12 cups of flour, it really saves space too. I called several local food stores and could not find anyone who could beat this price.

Unfortunately, just recently, Hershey signed an exclusive distribution contract with Cadbury, and chose not to allow exportation of many of the awesome European chocolate products to American retailers anymore. For shame on Hershey! And those of us who do not like wax in our chocolate, have to pay premium prices to get the good stuff. Definitely thankful for the smaller resellers out there on Amazon. I did a lot of researching; pricing out who had the best deal for Wispa bars. Note: never pay more than $1.99/bar (that includes shipping) but hopefully you can find it as cheap as $1.20 (depending how many you are willing to buy to get the deal). I purchased 12 bars for $1.50/each plus $3.15 shipping which came out to $1.20 a bar! The shipper included an ice pack to make sure the chocolate didn't melt or bloom. I am definitely planning on buying more from them when we eat up what we got.</td>\n",

I haven't had a single headache in the past 4 years, so I know how eating right is important.&lt;br /&gt;So what does eating right mean? I don't eat red meat; use organic food whenever available; and stay away from processed foods.&lt;br /&gt;Also, I have five meals a day (3 small main meals and 2 snacks), and I bag my lunch, usually a salad with a half chicken breast or fish, which I prepare the evening before.&lt;br /&gt;Okay, sorry for the long intro, now I'm getting to the review of the product... sometimes I can't prepare my lunch, I don't have time or I don't have salad; so it's nice to have an alternative.&lt;br /&gt;The gopicnic lunches are very convenient for that. Organic, calorie controlled, healthy, no trans fats, satisfying so they won't send you to the evil snack machine at the end of the hall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each package contains a little tub of salmon spread (quite tasty, a little sweet to my taste), Ritz-like crackers, a bag of dry-roasted edamame, a bag of trail-mix style fruit and nut mix, and a square of dark chocolate. There is also a plastic fork and even a puzzle at the bottom of the box, to keep you entertained after lunch!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tastewise, it's not bad, although I wouldn't eat it too often; but I like keeping a few on the shelf as backup for the days when I don't have time to make lunch.

As a result, I've tried a lot of tea-flavored powdered water enhancers but they all had a funny after taste.  The MIO sweet tea didn't have any such after taste.  I'm not saying that it tastes like my best home-made tea but it's not bad.  In fact, it's pretty good.<br /><br />As an extra bonus, MIO doesn't need to be refrigerated after opening which means you can toss it into your gym bag and the lid seems pretty secure although I would probably put in a ziplock bag first (I've had to deal with the trauma of cleaning up a shampoo spill in my gym bag-never again!).<br /><br />I'm looking forward to try some of the fruit flavors next.   \n",

A word of caution - salt tastes very salty. Why are you reading this, its salt for Pete's sake? I am pretty sure Iodized table salt has iodine in it. I do suggest buying this at a grocery store like a person to save about 7 dollars from the shipping cost.   \n",

Finally I did.  I was really disappointed.  I really find this oil very average.  It does smell nice but the flavor is somewhat weak, a little bland.  I guess because of the great reviews I expected more.  I suppose for general cooking this oil would be nice, but i wouldnt use it for a salad if I wanted to impress someone.<br />By the way, if you ever want to taste a great oil, see if you can get your hands on \"Protoulis\" oil from Greece.  So far it's the best oil I have ever come across.   \n",

This Fr Vanilla Cap has a great taste, creamy texture and needs nothing added to it.<br />But AGAIN, i read the product info and it stated (sugar/sucralose blend)<br /><br />I use SPLENDA brand sucralose anyway in my coffee. If you do not like the artificial sweetener, then do not order this product. But do not vote it down because you didn't read the info and/or sucralose leaves an after-taste.<br />I have no after-taste from it and therefore I enjoy this product very much.<br /><br />I use this in the B60 Keurig on the middle setting (8oz if i remember correctly)<br />My Pros:<br />-Good price<br />-Creamy texture<br />-Tastes great<br /><br />Will buy again<br />For people with the dopey comments:<br />Let me add: IT IS MACHINE-MADE cappuccino! What do you think a cheap Keurig is? Gourmet coffee?   \n",

These fit into your purse for on the go sweetening anywhere. No aftertaste and when you are counting carbs, every partial carb counts.<br /><br />I wasn't sure about 'how sweet' this was before I purchased but now I know that I use two drops in my huge coffee mug, versus three packets of the 'other stuff'...so I save three carbs per cup. I found these much easier to get the product out of than the large bottle.   \n",

I spoon the dough into them, smooth it with wet hands and let rise until it's doubled, then bake for about 25 minutes.  This makes two nice sized baguettes. If I'm in a hurry, I'll just make it in the breadmaker.  The kids like for me to make soft baked pretzels with this, and you can find the recipe (and many more) on the gluten free pantry website.   \n",

I don't have anything to compare it to, other than comparing freshly ground wheat flour from these berries and store bought wheat flour. My husband and I were previously buying wheat flour from our coop in the bulk section but had been wanting to get a grain grinder to start grinding our own wheat for nutritional value and freshness. When I grind this wheat to use for bread etc, it performs so much better than the already ground store bought flour. I had much better lift in yeast bread I made a couple weeks ago! I pretty much bake everything from scratch: our sandwich bread, cornbread, granola (that has a little bit of flour in it), desert breads, cakes, hamburger buns etc., so I just keep this in half gallon mason jars on top of some shelves. They look nice and since 8 cups of whole berries makes about 12 cups of flour, it really saves space too. I called several local food stores and could not find anyone who could beat this price. This shipped so fast that I couldn't imagine what was in the box. I will be ordering again!   \n",

I added the stand as I thought it was well designed and attractive. I am very pleased with the addition as the stand makes using the Aerator easier and it also prompts me to always use the Aerator, which I sometimes forgot to use before I had the stand. I have not experienced any of the dripping referred to in other reviews and I find the 6-piece set easy to use as well as effectively providing what the manufacturer promises to deliver.   \n",

Amazing results. I have been making homemake pizza for 20+ years now and always used bread or high-gluten flour. (Mostly King Arthur).<br /><br />In the past I have read about using Italian \"00\" flour but have not tried it. King Arthur offers \"00\" flour but I always thought the protien content was tool low, looked more like cake flour then something I would want to use for pizza.<br /><br />Surfing the other day I came across this flour and read about how much people loved it for making pizza. Seeing that it had a higher protien content (11% compared to KA's 8.5%) I though I would give it a try.<br /><br />Well based on last nights results I'm a fan and may never go back to HG flour again for pizza.<br /><br />The dough was very easy to work with (you will not be tossing this dough) very soft and easy to work with.<br /><br />I used the following bakers percentages:<br /><br />Italian \"00\" flour 100.00% (1 lb 4 oz approx 4.5 cups)<br />Water  57.00% (11.4 oz - approx 1.333 cups)<br />IDY  0.17%  (.03 oz - approx .333 tsp)<br />Salt, Fine  3.00%  (.6 oz - approx 1 tbsp)<br /><br />I use two 16 Oz balls for two 14\" pizza   \n",

It is light and airy, made of quality milk chocolate; a simple yet yummy and satisfying chocolate bar. Unfortunately, just recently, Hershey signed an exclusive distribution contract with Cadbury, and chose not to allow exportation of many of the awesome European chocolate products to American retailers anymore. For shame on Hershey! And those of us who do not like wax in our chocolate, have to pay premium prices to get the good stuff. Definitely thankful for the smaller resellers out there on Amazon. I did a lot of researching; pricing out who had the best deal for Wispa bars. Note: never pay more than $1.99/bar (that includes shipping) but hopefully you can find it as cheap as $1.20 (depending how many you are willing to buy to get the deal). I purchased 12 bars for $1.50/each plus $3.15 shipping which came out to $1.20 a bar! The shipper included an ice pack to make sure the chocolate didn't melt or bloom. I am definitely planning on buying more from them when we eat up what we got.   \n",

Mantova Grapeseed oil comes in glass, typical of the higher grade products and we like it very well. I have seen that this oil doesn't smoke as much when frying. I read that grapeseed oil doesn't break down at higher temperatures as does vegetable oils. The flavor is very light and smooth.   \n",

It's some kind of monstrous hybrid that I wouldn't have been able to finish had I not been starving and there was nothing else to eat. You can go to any country in Asia and I guarantee you'll never find a food like this. Only in America can you get away with adding cheese to everything.   \n",

I used to buy it in the powdered, but then the liquid came out and we used that.  Then now they have this concentrated creamer which is the best yet, we beleive it tastes better than the liquid and the powdered.  Also, it gives you more for your dollar.  The only downside is the pump.  Really cool idea if you could only remove it after putting it on.  I could understand at a business where you wouldn't want people tampering with it, but the pump leaves a  lot of creamer left in the bottom yet.  We leave it off and just pour it into the coffee, and when there is only a little left, we pour some coffee in it and get the rest out.  Also another plus, the container is recyclable in a lot of areas.  Go CoffeeMate!   \n",

All of them taste the same, lack any real cheese taste. I bought it because they said Organic and I figured I would have a healthier option for cheat food. \"Creamy\" are you kidding me, there is hardly enough sauce to coat the shells. The \"Aged\" doesn't even come close to tasting like aged cheddar..pretty much mild. 2 stars for attempting to make a strong flavoured mac and cheese though.<br /><br />Now i will say I do like my strong cheeses, balderson 7 year cheddar, asiago etc.<br /><br />Kraft the only flavour I like is Sharp Cheddar I can even add meat to it and still keep some of the flavour, others taste the same as Annie's so if you like mild or medium cheddar maybe you can eat this stuff but I find myself adding in some real cheese to get some taste. Not exactly sure how you can call mass produced food \"organic\" but those laws will be changing.<br /><br />And just taking a bite after typing that...taste like noodles with butter.   \n",

He had surgery on his knee so he couldn't run around or play. He was getting so bored! I bought him the large size and it has been amazing for him! He loves it when we put the \"caps\" in the ends or put treats in the middle. If we put 1 \"cap\" on it, it last at least 3 days! When I recently put both on it lasted him a week! I am so glad we found a way to keep him entertained while he is recovering from his surgery!   \n",

But oh my goodness, I couldn't even swallow the first piece.  Even my dog stopped eating them after 2 pieces.<br /><br />It's hard to describe the flavor other than salty and metallic (I got the Teriyaki).  The jerky is also alarmingly thick and covered with this sawdust-like powder, and most of the pieces have broken up into crumbs.<br /><br />I will definitely not be finishing the bag I opened, and hopefully I'll be able to give the other 5 bags to someone who is hungry enough to take them.  I'm not one to complain about products, but I've also never felt so strongly about spreading the news to stay away from this stuff.   \n",

It is just a thicker liquid like tomato soup.<br />You could call that my fault for not knowing what split pea soup is except the<br />packaging shows a spoonful with chunks of what looks like peas and carrots...<br />I assumed the dried variety like you find in a cup o soup.<br /><br />Overall the soup is palatable, I mean I'll finish the rest, but will not be leaving<br />on the subscribe and save to send me another batch.   \n",

However much of the aromatic oils that are part of the experience of drinking tea are missing.<br /><br />The packaging of this product may have something to do with this - each bunch of 50 tea bags is placed into a cardboard box which is wrapped in a thin sheet of plastic. 6 of these wrapped boxes are then placed into a holder which is then also wrapped in plastic wrap. Given the thin plastic used the aromatic oils are lost pretty soon after manufacture.<br /><br />Other manufactures individually wrap their tea bags in individual foil lined pouches. Others use heaver plastic to hold the oils in.<br /><br />If you are fussy about tea I'd pass. T**d*r J**s has better decaf tea than this.   \n",
       "388768  A few years ago I made a huge lifestyle change. I used to eat everything in sight, loved processed food, never ate any fruits and few vegetables, was overweight and sluggish.<br />I started exercising and learned how to eat right, lost 90 lbs and never felt better in my entire life. I haven't had a single headache in the past 4 years, so I know how eating right is important.<br />So what does eating right mean? I don't eat red meat; use organic food whenever available; and stay away from processed foods.<br />Also, I have five meals a day (3 small main meals and 2 snacks), and I bag my lunch, usually a salad with a half chicken breast or fish, which I prepare the evening before.<br />Okay, sorry for the long intro, now I'm getting to the review of the product... sometimes I can't prepare my lunch, I don't have time or I don't have salad; so it's nice to have an alternative.<br />The gopicnic lunches are very convenient for that. Organic, calorie controlled, healthy, no trans fats, satisfying so they won't send you to the evil snack machine at the end of the hall.<br /><br />Each package contains a little tub of salmon spread (quite tasty, a little sweet to my taste), Ritz-like crackers, a bag of dry-roasted edamame, a bag of trail-mix style fruit and nut mix, and a square of dark chocolate. There is also a plastic fork and even a puzzle at the bottom of the box, to keep you entertained after lunch!<br /><br />Tastewise, it's not bad, although I wouldn't eat it too often; but I like keeping a few on the shelf as backup for the days when I don't have time to make lunch. Make sure to complement it with a piece of fruit though!   \n",

Libby excellent products but until they stop sneaking these very badly dented cans thru to Amazon no more orders -<br /><br />>>Amazon great as always ... but here is the PROOF Libby's is processing dented cans to Amazon to unknowingly sell to consumer........... Every shipment to date has had dented cans - severely in some cases rendering product not edible per standards....this case of carrots had a can 'in the center' before they wrap to to send to Amazon warehouse. This can severely dented....BUT no marks on the wrapper - suggesting they re-wrapped before sealing to your warehouse for sale to Amazon customers ........   \n",

I don't have anything to compare it to other than comparing freshly ground wheat flour from these berries and store bought wheat flour My husband and I were previously buying wheat flour from our coop in the bulk section but had been wanting to get a grain grinder to start grinding our own wheat for nutritional value and freshness When I grind this wheat to use for bread etc it performs so much better than the already ground store bought flour I had much better lift in yeast bread I made a couple weeks ago ! I pretty much bake everything from scratch: our sandwich bread cornbread granola (that has a little bit of flour in it) desert breads cakes hamburger buns etc so I just keep this in half gallon mason jars on top of some shelves They look nice and since 8 cups of whole berries makes about 12 cups of flour it really saves space too I called several local food stores and could not find anyone who could beat this price This shipped so fast that I couldn't imagine what was in the box I will be ordering again !  \n",

And those of us who do not like wax in our chocolate have to pay premium prices to get the good stuff Definitely thankful for the smaller resellers out there on Amazon I did a lot of researching pricing out who had the best deal for Wispa bars Note: never pay more than 199bar (that includes shipping) but hopefully you can find it as cheap as 120 (depending how many you are willing to buy to get the deal) I purchased 12 bars for 150each plus 315 shipping which came out to 120 a bar ! The shipper included an ice pack to make sure the chocolate didn't melt or bloom I am definitely planning on buying more from them when we eat up what we got  \n",

I bought him the large size and it has been amazing for him ! He loves it when we put the caps in the ends or put treats in the middle If we put 1 cap on it it last at least 3 days ! When I recently put both on it lasted him a week ! I am so glad we found a way to keep him entertained while he is recovering from his surgery !  \n",

       "186185  The first thing I noticed when I opened the box was that every bar wrapper was oily. Don't know if something leaked or it came like that from the factory.  So far every bar has been well sealed.  I wasn't thrilled with the first bite because I was expecting something sweeter and dryer like I have had in the past. But now that I'm used to the taste and texture I really like them.  They even feel healthy. They are very filling and make me feel that I had a nutritious snack.  You might want to try one before buying a whole box, but I do find them quite tasty   \n",

BPA is an element in plastics that is excess estrogen and its recently become known that its not beneficial to let it enter our bodies. However, BPA is only activated once its been heated and since you arent heating the metal lid, the BPA never enters the food. EB baby food is spectacular especially since its jar food vs frozen/fresh. There are lots of yummy flavors and your baby will probably like most of them. Both of my sons go crazy over the EB varieties and I stick by it- buying it by the case and using the amazon subscription option makes it soo much cheaper than retail!

       "      <td>I like the taste of this sweetener and I am a huge fan of stevia, but my problem with it is that agave is the first ingredient. Now, contrary to popular myth, as someone in the food biz I can say that that does NOT mean it's mostly agave. As you can verify on the FDA website, ingredients are not listed in the order of what they contain most of as most people believe, but they are listed in order of weight...which means if there are 2 ounces of agave in a pack and one ounce of stevia, (I just made that weight up for explanation) then agave will be read first...even is there is a tablespoon of agave and 2 tablespoons of stevia in a packed (again, that amount is used just for explanation...doesn't contain near that much in a packet.). Since stevia weighs next to nothing, it still may very well be the main ingredient, but we do know there is a good deal of agave... and that's my issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually switched to stevia from using agave as a sweetener (although I still use it occasionally.) because of the controversy and studies showing that it may very well have the same weight-gain effects as high fructose corn syrup due to how your body processes it. There are some very well respected doctors such as Dr Mercola who say this. I scoffed at first, until more reports said the same. I haven't made up my mind yet, but in the meantime I cut back on agave so when I bought stevia I didn't expect to find it there. But it's listed first in these packets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why do they add another sweetener? Stevia is SO sweet that you have to. It takes a few grains to sweeten a drink...there would be nothing in the packet otherwise. However, I perfer to find it cut with erithritol as this does not spike your blood sure, is all natural, and zero calories.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I now simply buy straight stevia in order to sweeten my coffee...in liquid form. It's not mixed with anything and is very economical. One drop sweetens an entire cup of coffee and the liquid form means it mixes perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This isn't a bad sweetener...it could be a bit sweeter if I had my say...but my main gripe is I believe they'd have better marketing if they cut it with another natural zero calorie sweetener with less current controversy.  For agave lovers, however, it would be the best pick. For me, I'm lukewarm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, add to that it has silica...this is not in any other stevia products I've bought. Look, I just want stevia...or a stevia and eriythritol blend...but not a mix of stevia and stuff I don't want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyone consuming stevia is likely a label reader so I think this product would do well to tigthen its' belt in order to compete...and by that, I mean stick with cleaner ingredients.</td>\n",

Since Dave's Ghost Pepper Naga Jolokia hot sauce seemed to have the best reviews it is the one I picked.  At only five ounces it is not exactly a bargain.  Keeping in mind the fact that I could not find any sauces containing the Ghost pepper locally I was not concerned with the price.  So I took a leap of faith in Dave's sauce.  I was not disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received my bottle in only two days using Amazon Prime.  It came in bubble wrap and was completely safe in it's packaging.  After popping off the seal I took a big whiff and passed it around the room.  The aroma was fantastic and a kick in the face at the same time.  Our mouths watered immediately.  Ignoring the warnings of my family, I had to try a dab on my finger right away.  The taste was great but soon came a wave of intense heat which overpowered the taste.  My eyes watered and I smiled in satisfaction as I reached for a cold beverage.  My money did not go to waste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At dinner time I decided it would go great on my chicken.  I only wanted to pour a little on.  I shook the bottle anticipating the thickness would not allow the sauce to come easily out of the bottle.  I was wrong.  A big glob covered my meal.  My wife argued with me not to eat all of it and get some off the chicken.  But like most husbands, I did not listen to my wife.  I did not want to waste it.  So i took the first bite...excellent taste...but then....oh god...for some reason the spiciness made me crazily devour the whole thing.  What a dumb thing to do.  The next half hour was torture.  My eyes were running and red, I got the hiccups and felt as though I wanted to throw up but did not.  I drank all of my soda fast.  I slammed my hands on the table in agony as my wife prepared the milk which could not come fast enough.  I was in bad shape.  I would not wish it on the worst of my enemies.  Dave...You got me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On closer inspection of the bottle, after my episode, I discovered the warning.  Use a drop at a time.  Bah! Stupid me.  Well...you know what they say.  Good stories usually start out with a bad decision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product should come with a dropper.  It is definitely a favorite in my book.

       "      <td>I have been struggling to find ready-made mixes for my now six-year-old child ever since she was diagnosed with Celiac Disease two years ago.  I have gone through A LOT of flours, mixes, recipes and baking disasters.  My daughter also has a sensitivity to corn - there aren't many mixes or products that are free of corn (cornstarch, corn flour, traditionally-made baking powder, etc.) and this one is essentially (if not totally) free of corn.  It also produces awesome pancakes, an easy coating for chicken nuggets, a thickener in place of wheat flour for stew broth, and it totally flies under the radar of the rest of the family as being a GF mix. I stock up on the 3-pack of the 4 lb. bags now because I use it almost every day.  I've never reviewed anything before, but thought that this might actually help someone struggling with how to feed a GF child.</td>\n",

I found them to be very versatile, as well. I added ingredients here or there--whatever I happened to have in the cupboard/freezer, like black beans, green chilies, chicken breast, etc.--and these soups really impressed. I was particularly excited about the low sodium and low calories in the soups. I'm on a low fat/low calorie diet, and these worked out tremendously well for me. I'm definitely going to buy these again!   \n",

Im a very cautious parent, but the fact that there is BPA in the lids doesnt affect the food or the quality of it. BPA is an element in plastics that is excess estrogen and its recently become known that its not beneficial to let it enter our bodies. However, BPA is only activated once its been heated and since you arent heating the metal lid, the BPA never enters the food. EB baby food is spectacular especially since its jar food vs frozen/fresh. There are lots of yummy flavors and your baby will probably like most of them. Both of my sons go crazy over the EB varieties and I stick by it- buying it by the case and using the amazon subscription option makes it soo much cheaper than retail! Again... dont freak out over BPA in the lids lol.   \n",

I purchased a My K-cup for the unit which allowed me to use regular canned coffee but what was I going to do about the tea? I tried opening tea bags and using that tea but it was weak and flat. Next I tried using this tea and it worked perfect (but a word of caution...remove the tea leaves from the filter while moist to make removal easier). No more brewing an entire teapot for just a quick morning cup and no waiting for tea bags to brew and it tastes great!!! Not weak and off taste but perfect. My tea consumption has increased to the point that I now use the Amazon auto ship to receive 6 boxes at a time so that I never run out. If you have a Keurig and love tea this product is the perfect solution...you won't be disappointed.   \n",

The 3 pack is a great price especially with auto delivery. It would be unaffordable otherwise. I plan on mixing up my auto delivery with different flavors. But this Maya French Roast is probably the best imitation of coffee in the line. However, starting to find out that everything is good especially with a little Soy Creamer to go with it!   \n",

Many have claimed that these are some of the best of the Lavazza line, but I have to firmly disagree.<br />Although I have had delicious Lavazza coffee at restaurants, Lavazza's whole-bean coffee end needs to perform better quality control--despite an expiry date of August 2013, the beans I purchased have so far made just awful coffee, with a weak flavor, harsh acidity and a slightly stale taste as both drip coffee and espresso.<br /><br />I can't blame Amazon since the beans are indeed good for another 18 months, but buyer beware!   \n",
       "363514  I like the taste of this sweetener and I am a huge fan of stevia, but my problem with it is that agave is the first ingredient. Now, contrary to popular myth, as someone in the food biz I can say that that does NOT mean it's mostly agave. As you can verify on the FDA website, ingredients are not listed in the order of what they contain most of as most people believe, but they are listed in order of weight...which means if there are 2 ounces of agave in a pack and one ounce of stevia, (I just made that weight up for explanation) then agave will be read first...even is there is a tablespoon of agave and 2 tablespoons of stevia in a packed (again, that amount is used just for explanation...doesn't contain near that much in a packet.). Since stevia weighs next to nothing, it still may very well be the main ingredient, but we do know there is a good deal of agave... and that's my issue.<br /><br />I actually switched to stevia from using agave as a sweetener (although I still use it occasionally.) because of the controversy and studies showing that it may very well have the same weight-gain effects as high fructose corn syrup due to how your body processes it. There are some very well respected doctors such as Dr Mercola who say this. I scoffed at first, until more reports said the same. I haven't made up my mind yet, but in the meantime I cut back on agave so when I bought stevia I didn't expect to find it there. But it's listed first in these packets.<br /><br />Why do they add another sweetener? Stevia is SO sweet that you have to. It takes a few grains to sweeten a drink...there would be nothing in the packet otherwise. However, I perfer to find it cut with erithritol as this does not spike your blood sure, is all natural, and zero calories.<br /><br />I now simply buy straight stevia in order to sweeten my coffee...in liquid form. It's not mixed with anything and is very economical. One drop sweetens an entire cup of coffee and the liquid form means it mixes perfectly.<br /><br />This isn't a bad sweetener...it could be a bit sweeter if I had my say...but my main gripe is I believe they'd have better marketing if they cut it with another natural zero calorie sweetener with less current controversy.  For agave lovers, however, it would be the best pick. For me, I'm lukewarm.<br /><br />Now, add to that it has silica...this is not in any other stevia products I've bought. Look, I just want stevia...or a stevia and eriythritol blend...but not a mix of stevia and stuff I don't want.<br /><br />Anyone consuming stevia is likely a label reader so I think this product would do well to tigthen its' belt in order to compete...and by that, I mean stick with cleaner ingredients.   \n",

If resturants served JAVA Teeccino I would<br />choose it over real coffee. The only time I prefer real coffee is if I am driving late at night and I need the caffeine to stay awake.   \n",

I normally don't like the taste of nuts in my coffee and was expecting to not like it, but I love this coffee.  I have been drinking Folgers French Vanilla coffee for years partly because I like the smell of it brewing first thing in the morning.  The Hawaiian Hazelnut also has a wonderful smell first thing in the morning, but the taste is even better!  It does not have the slightly bitter taste that the Folgers has and I actually look forward to that first cup of coffee in the morning again - instead of just drinking it to kick-start the day.   \n",

It's excellent Blue Mountain coffee.  Not over roasted, mellow and smooth.  I own a Keurig brewer and this is one of the two (the other is a Kona) that I try to always have on hand for my fresh ground morning brew.  It beats K-cups by a mile.   \n",

This one is very nice and fits the bill for my dwarf ornamental pomegranate trees. Another reviewer gave it one star because of its size and price, but both of these are known before purchasing, so I don't agree with that review. I found the pot to be as advertised and a good value.   \n",

This is not a powder mix, so the concentrated liquid mixes with water very easily (you almost don't have to even mix it).  Great taste for a diet product, and you can mix in the exact amount of your liquid to suit your own taste.  I like that you can even slip a little into your glass of water without making an entire pitcher of the stuff (not like most packet-based products that force you to make a quart of the stuff). A nice product if you like peach tea.   \n",

This prices out to over $3.50 per pack which is more than  double other sources.  Shame on you,  Drugstore911,  I will never buy anything from you again.   \n",

But, I will be honest: it took a few tries. It's very different from the types of tea you might be used to.<br /><br />Anyway, I recently bought this House brand from an Asian supermarket because it doesn't require any boiling. Simply fill a pitcher with water, throw in a bag, and come back in an hour or so.  The taste is just what I was expecting: mellow and earthy, without any bitter aftertaste. It suggests one bag for a quart of water, but it will make 2 quarts just fine.<br /><br />I give 4 stars not because of any flaws. The tea was fine in every way. But, there was really nothing to make it worthy of 5 stars. I imagine one day I'll find a Barley Tea that gives something extra, which elevates the medium with its subtlety and tone. But, House brand is quite good, and perfectly refreshing.   \n",

I even tried several local Chinese import stores to no avail.  Extreme Health's oolong tea, however, is exactly what I was looking for; a bold oolong tea, like I used to find in Japan, with dried bundles of leaves that expand to fill the tea pot.  When I first bought this tea, I thought the price was a little high, but you can steep the leaves multiple times to get quite a lot of tea.<br /><br />I liked the tea well enough to sign up for a delivery subscription.   \n",

The company has apparently totally eliminated production of plain green tea in favor of blends with white tea. On the box it says \"with White Tea for Smooth Taste.\"<br /><br />Smooth taste my foot -- the white tea bitters it.<br /><br />Can you imagine if you're a Folgers drinker 3 times a day for 10 years and then all of the sudden Folgers adds Essence of Municipal Garbage to its coffee? Yeah -- that's what celestial seasonings did to me. Thanks, guys!<br /><br />You forced me to go Bigelow!   \n",

I will take it. I was pleasantly surprised with the taste of the cookie. I thought it wouldn't have much flavor but it does. The spice of the cookie and the raisins make it a delicious treat. Now it is a soft baked cookie but to me it was a tad bit dry. It was still edible and good. I will pick up a box once they are available.   \n",

This definitely cuts down on packaging and guilt for me.  Taste is great also.   \n",

My entire family drank this Chococino in 2 days!  Easy to make and extremely tasty!  Put in the milk packet first then add the chocolate.  Delicious!  Keep any eye on the machine, however, as you must manually stop it when you've made your Chococino to your liking.   \n",

Since Dave's Ghost Pepper Naga Jolokia hot sauce seemed to have the best reviews it is the one I picked.  At only five ounces it is not exactly a bargain.  Keeping in mind the fact that I could not find any sauces containing the Ghost pepper locally I was not concerned with the price.  So I took a leap of faith in Dave's sauce.  I was not disappointed.<br /><br />I received my bottle in only two days using Amazon Prime.  It came in bubble wrap and was completely safe in it's packaging.  After popping off the seal I took a big whiff and passed it around the room.  The aroma was fantastic and a kick in the face at the same time.  Our mouths watered immediately.  Ignoring the warnings of my family, I had to try a dab on my finger right away.  The taste was great but soon came a wave of intense heat which overpowered the taste.  My eyes watered and I smiled in satisfaction as I reached for a cold beverage.  My money did not go to waste.<br /><br />At dinner time I decided it would go great on my chicken.  I only wanted to pour a little on.  I shook the bottle anticipating the thickness would not allow the sauce to come easily out of the bottle.  I was wrong.  A big glob covered my meal.  My wife argued with me not to eat all of it and get some off the chicken.  But like most husbands, I did not listen to my wife.  I did not want to waste it.  So i took the first bite...excellent taste...but then....oh god...for some reason the spiciness made me crazily devour the whole thing.  What a dumb thing to do.  The next half hour was torture.  My eyes were running and red, I got the hiccups and felt as though I wanted to throw up but did not.  I drank all of my soda fast.  I slammed my hands on the table in agony as my wife prepared the milk which could not come fast enough.  I was in bad shape.  I would not wish it on the worst of my enemies.  Dave...You got me.<br /><br />On closer inspection of the bottle, after my episode, I discovered the warning.  Use a drop at a time.  Bah! Stupid me.  Well...you know what they say.  Good stories usually start out with a bad decision.<br /><br />This product should come with a dropper.  It is definitely a favorite in my book.  I will buy it again but with more respect for the sauce.   \n",

I steep mine longer than 5 minutes though more like 10 as like a stronger peach flavor and I use twice as many tea bags as it says for a cup. It taste really good with sugar in it.   \n",

Now that I found it on Amazon I'm very happy. It's the type of soup no one else makes. You can add your own ingredients to it as well or its great by itself. Better than most Chinese restuarants make.   \n",

I had never tried this product before and was concerned it might not be very good considering the very inexpensive price.<br />The bottles arrived in great condition. I tried some of the dressing on a salad and found it to be very tasty. The tangy mustard, sweet honey, and the vidalia onion make a great combination. I've since used it as a light sauce for pasta, drizzled over steamed vegetables, and as a marinade for grilled chicken. In each case, the results were very tasty.<br />They are priced higher as of this review. But at just over the current price price of 6.00 a bottle - they are still a good value. The bottles are quite large and will last a long time.<br />Very pleased with this purchase.   \n",

I slipped it back on and all is well. I did this after reading other reviews, I was not alone.  Simple solution, no problem.   \n",

Hail Merry is advertising this product as raw and it isn't, that is false advertising. Out of six ingredients only two are raw. The Coconut oil and sea salt are the only raw ingredients in this product. See back of package for   \n",

And I must have gotten sick 5 times. Vitamin pills always have an unappealing smell and vitamin gummies are pretty expensive. I just bought Vplenish but I'm already addicted. There is no weird-vitamin taste and I actually feel like I'm preventing sickness. I'm bringing all my leftover packets with me to college in the fall. It'll be really easy to mix them into my canteen of water or cranberry juice before classes.   \n",

I hadn't tried it before, and was worried that I had made a big mistake, buying it. I was supprised after my first cup, at it's strength, and full bodied flavor. It is now my most favorite k-cup coffee. I was never into \"Decaf\" before, and I feel that this coffee will make, both Decaf and Regular coffee drinkers alike, very happy. Don't hessitate to try this blend, you will not be sorry.   \n",

I received these and they were a mushy mess and they don't allow returns which really suck!  I tried to upload pictures because they were a brown mess that looked like you know what.  I don't know why they shipped these without any coolant but I had them delivered to California and Marich is in California also so its not like they had to come far.  I am deeply disgusted that these arrived this way and now I have 3 boxes of melted chocolate that is non edible and am out my money.  This is not good for Amazon or Marich.  I have ordered the cherries many times and normally they are sent with dry ice when sent so they don't melt.  Very dissappointed and would not recommend to anyone to buy this product.  I tried to upload pictures but they did not take but I do have them!   \n",

I have gone through A LOT of flours, mixes, recipes and baking disasters.  My daughter also has a sensitivity to corn - there aren't many mixes or products that are free of corn (cornstarch, corn flour, traditionally-made baking powder, etc.) and this one is essentially (if not totally) free of corn.  It also produces awesome pancakes, an easy coating for chicken nuggets, a thickener in place of wheat flour for stew broth, and it totally flies under the radar of the rest of the family as being a GF mix. I stock up on the 3-pack of the 4 lb. bags now because I use it almost every day.  I've never reviewed anything before, but thought that this might actually help someone struggling with how to feed a GF child.   \n",

       "2  This is a confection that has been around a few centuries.  It is a light, pillowy citrus gelatin with nuts - in this case Filberts. And it is cut into tiny squares and then liberally coated with powdered sugar.  And it is a tiny mouthful of heaven.  Not too chewy, and very flavorful.  I highly recommend this yummy treat.  If you are familiar with the story of C.S. Lewis' \"The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe\" - this is the treat that seduces Edmund into selling out his Brother and Sisters to the Witch.   \n",
